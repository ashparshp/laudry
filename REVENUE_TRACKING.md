## Overview

The laundry service now tracks revenue only from **delivered orders**, ensuring accurate financial reporting.

## How it Works

### 1. **Revenue Calculation**

### 3. **Order Status Flow**

```
New Order → Pending → Processing → Ready → Delivered (💰 Revenue Added)
                                        ↘️ Cancelled (❌ No Revenue)
```

### 4. **When Revenue is Added**

- 🔄 **Order Created**: No revenue counted (status: pending)

## Status Colors

## Example Revenue Calculation

```
Order #1: ₹150 (Pending) → Not counted
Order #2: ₹200 (Processing) → Not counted
